<h3>Got your back</h3>
<h4>Aug 23, 2020</h4>
"Yeshtu guru cycle?" meaning "How much did you pay for the cycle?" asked the tender coconut vendor on Kanakpura road. Though I understood the question, I had no answer. I had drawn a blank! After ages, I had pedalled a whopping 100+kms for the first time and was exhaused beyond comprehension. Ignoring the questions, I started pedalling again. After 10 seconds, thought may be pushing is a good idea. 10 seconds later, thought resting is a better idea. 10 seconds later, thought may be putting it in a bus and get done with it was the best idea. This exercise and battle of wits happened for the next  hour or so. Moments later, saw Sudu waiting on a bench on the roadside. I apologized for keeping him waiting for so long and he said "We started together, let's finish together, no matter what!". I was overwhelmed. Over a period, this has happened so many times, that I've seriously lost count. Reminds me of the quote in the book, "The Kite Runner":
"For you, a thousand times over": It's the sincere devotion between friends, the extent being limitless and the willingness to achieve greater heights, small or big, easy or difficult, over and over again.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Godsend</h3>
<h4>Jan 23, 2021</h4>
It was dark, cold and lonely and I found myself staring at the road amidst a constant barrage of highway lorries in both directions. I got down from the saddle and screamed in nerve-wrenching pain. There wasn't a single muscle in my body which wasn't sore from all the time I had spent attempting to ride a 300 BRM. 
</p>
<p>
"Must be an aeroplane!" was my first thought as something grabbed my attention from up above. I saw moving foggy lights headed straight towards me! 2 seconds later, I realized those were the headlights of a truck headed in the opposite direction on Nh44. Clearly, I was "seeing" things and my exhaustion was at a tipping point.
</p>
<p>
Soon after, "Incoming call from 'Kishore'", said my bluetooth headset. In the next 2 mins, Kishore and little Samu had found me, given me a yummy sandwich, refilled my water bottles, stuffed my pockets with snacks, and most importantly made me not to give up. Not when I was this close to a finish. The feeling was not of having found a cup of water in a desert, it was more of finding an oasis. With the spirit re-kindled, I was ready for more! Kishore was a God send.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Break a sweat</h3>
<h4>Mar 6, 2021</h4>
"Come on sir, there's less than a hour left!". Roared Sagar, with infectious enthusiasm. Deepu, the untamed bull wasn't far behind. The scorching afternoon heat, on the East Coast Road made completing the last 20 odd kms of the Pondy BRM an ever lasting ordeal. That was when Sagar taught me drafting. We 3 rode in a close line one behind the other, with Sagar riding up front, making sure there's less energy spent.
</p>
<p>
At the beginning of every BRM, Sagar takes an oath to accompany the last person and makes them finish on time. This time was no different. We had so much fun riding together, wish it had lasted longer! And viola, the chequered flag greeted us at Auroville! To Sagar, the kiddo, a man of his word, I owe the finish of my longest ride till date!
</p>
<p>
<h3>Yesterday, today and everyday</h3>
Mastery over the mind is essential in a tough, endurance sport like cycling. When your legs are screaming and lungs burning, your mind can quickly become your enemy. It all comes down to mental toughness, and luckily it can be learned, but it takes practice to tame the mind and turn it into a force that works for you rather than against. Thankfully, in my cycling journey with <b>VeloKofi</b>, I've found giants like Sudu, Kishore and Sagar to accompany me. As Sir Issac Newton says:
"We are like dwarfs sitting on the shoulders of giants. We see more, and things that are more distant, than they did, not because our sight is superior or because we are taller than they, but because they raise us up, and by their great stature add to ours."
